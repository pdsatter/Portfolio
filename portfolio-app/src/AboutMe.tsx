            <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
            <p>
                I will be graduating from the University of Houston in December 2023 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics. 
                Throughout my academic journey, I've maintained a 3.7 GPA and consistently earned a place on the dean's list. 
                My passion lies in <strong>full-stack development</strong>, where I've gained valuable experience and honed my skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects throughout my career.
                This includes the research I did for UH Energy.  I took their excel model and was
                able to create a dynamic web based model.  I had to go through the full process of 
                development for this project. This included <strong>planning, coding, and deploying</strong> my work.
                I used <strong>flask</strong> for the backend and <strong>javascript</strong> and <strong>html</strong> for the front end.
                The only part of the web design I did not do was adding the UH standard CSS to the page.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I was a varsity wrestler in high school, and <strong>wrestling</strong> is my favorite sport by far.
                I am on my journey of learning other martial arts such as muay thai and judo.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love learning new skills. One interesting skill I learned is <strong>juggling</strong>.
                Juggling takes a lot of work to learn, but learning the tricks is worth it in the end.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also love to game in my free time.  Some of my favorite games are <strong>Rocket League, Super Smash Bros, CS2, and Rainbow Six Siege</strong>.
