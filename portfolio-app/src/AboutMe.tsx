            <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from the University of Houston in December 2023 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics. 
                Throughout my academic journey, I've maintained a 3.7 GPA and consistently earned a place on the dean's list. 
                My passion lies in <strong>full-stack development</strong>, where I've gained valuable experience and honed my skills.
            </p>

                I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects throughout my career.
                This includes the research I did for UH Energy.  I took their excel model and was
                able to create a dynamic web based model.  I had to go through the full process of 
                development for this project. This included <strong>planning, coding, and deploying</strong> my work.
                I used <strong>flask</strong> for the backend and <strong>javascript</strong> and <strong>html</strong> for the front end.
                The only part of the web design I did not do was adding the UH standard CSS to the page.
