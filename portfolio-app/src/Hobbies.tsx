            <h4>Wrestling</h4>
            <p>
                I was a varsity wrestler in high school, and <strong>wrestling</strong> is my favorite sport by far.
                I am on my journey of learning other martial arts such as muay thai and judo.

            <h4>Juggling</h4>
            <p>
                I love learning new skills. One interesting skill I learned is <strong>juggling</strong>.
                Juggling takes a lot of work to learn, but learning the tricks is worth it in the end.
            </p>

            <h4>Gaming</h4>
            <p>
                I also love to game in my free time.  Some of my favorite games are <strong>Rocket League, CS2, Super Smash Bros, and Rainbow Six Siege</strong>.
